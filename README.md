# Missile-Escape
A replica of missile escape made using SFML and Box2D.
I saw this video of the game Missile Escape (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kolibri.MissileEscape&hl=en_IN), and I thought the gameplay was cool. So, I decided to try to implement it for myself, see what it would entail, and these are the results.

In this project I made the bare bones of a Game Engine and implement Vector math to get the homing missile to have linear and angular acceleration and implement movement in the local axis using rotations.
